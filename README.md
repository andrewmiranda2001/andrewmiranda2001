Hello everyone! 

I am Andrew Miranda and am currently studying Computer Science at Northeastern University. 
I've always been interested in the problem-solving aspect of math and fell in love with Computer Science right as high school was ending. 
Looking forward to a career of engaging work and, most of all, working to make the world a better place.

I have listed some of my projects from school along with a description of each.
